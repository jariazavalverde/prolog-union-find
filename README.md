# Union-find data structure in Prolog
## A union-find algorithm implementation for SWI-Prolog

A unionâ€“find data structure is a data structure that tracks a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It provides near-constant-time operations to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine whether elements are in the same set.

## Installation (SWI-Prolog)

```prolog
?- pack_install(union_find).
```

## Usage

* **union_find/2**
* **make_set/2**
* **union/3**
* **find/3**
* **find/4**
